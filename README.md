**WARNING: This is a work in progress. While we migrate the old android app, we will be switching to react native for its UI, rather than Cordova.**

This is the ConnectorDB android app.

The app gathers the following in the background:

- [x] Steps
- [x] Activities
- [x] Plug in events
- [x] Location (GPS)
- [x] Screen on/off
- [ ] Active App
